# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release.
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements**
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed, deprecated, and removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes
 - migration guidance
 - changed behaviour

The versions coincide with releases on pypi. Only major versions will be released as tags on GitHub.

## [0.0.x](https://github.com/converged-computing/fluxterm/tree/main) (0.0.x)
 - Support for emoji job states (0.0.1)
 - Initial creation of project skeleton (0.0.0)
